/**
 * spawn() an agent CLI by bare command name, portably.
 *
 * On Windows an `npm i -g` package leaves two files side by side: `claude` (a POSIX sh
 * script, for Git Bash) and `claude.cmd` (the native shim). Neither is directly spawnable
 * without help — the extension-less script is not a PE image (spawn reports ENOENT), and
 * since Node 18.20 spawning a .cmd/.bat without a shell is refused outright (EINVAL) as an
 * argument-injection guard. Every turn then dies as a bare "spawn claude ENOENT".
 *
 * So on win32: resolve the command against PATHEXT and, when the winner is a batch shim, run
 * it as `cmd.exe /d /s /c <shim> <args...>`. That rather than `shell: true` because both end
 * up in cmd.exe, but shell:true concatenates argv into one command line with no escaping
 * (Node's DEP0190); spawning cmd.exe ourselves keeps every argument a discrete argv entry.
 *
 * A `.mjs`/`.js`/`.cjs` target gets `process.execPath` prepended: Windows has no shebang, so
 * a `#!/usr/bin/env node` script is not executable there no matter its mode bits. Any other
 * absolute path the caller resolved, and every non-Windows platform, spawns unchanged.

/**
 * Terminate a child FOR GOOD: end its stdin, then SIGTERM, then SIGKILL — each step only if

 *
 * Why this exists rather than a bare {@link sigterm}: every teardown site used to fire one
 * signal and forget the child. A `claude -p` that ignored both stdin EOF and that single
 * SIGTERM — a large-transcript flush, an MCP server wedging its own shutdown — was then
 * unreferenced by the pool AND by its turn, so nothing would ever try again. Observed in the
 * wild as `claude` processes resident for 14 hours at ~400 MB each with no session behind them.
 *
 * `graceMs: 0` skips straight to SIGTERM (the old `kill=true` semantics — nothing is left
 * running in the background, so there is nothing to wait for). A positive grace preserves the
 * reason the graceful path exists: the CLI persists the turn into its session jsonl AFTER
 * emitting `result`, and killing it mid-write loses the reply from the transcript.
 *
 * `group: true` (for a child spawned `detached`) widens ONLY the final SIGKILL to the child's
 * process group. The ladder's earlier steps stay aimed at the child alone on purpose: stdin EOF
 * and SIGTERM both let the CLI shut its own subprocesses down in order, which it does properly.
 * SIGKILL is the case where it CANNOT, so whatever it spawned is on its own.
 *
 * Most of that tree survives a hard kill only briefly: an MCP server talks to the CLI over a
 * stdio pipe, so the pipe breaking is its own EOF and it exits — measured, with claude's four
 * default MCP servers all gone within seconds of `kill -9` on the CLI alone. This covers the
 * rest: a subprocess holding no pipe back to the CLI (`stdio: 'ignore'`), or one that ignores
 * EOF, reparents to init and then nothing in the system knows it exists. Cheap insurance, and
 * the same thing the PTY path already does deliberately when it hangs up a terminal.
 *
 * Timers are `unref`'d so a reap in flight never holds a one-shot embedder's event loop open;
 * they still fire in any live process, and the `exit` listener is what guarantees the ladder
 * stops early rather than the timers being cancelled from outside.
