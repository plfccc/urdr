# Urdr

A layered, open Agent orchestrator — a streamlined fork of [pikiloom](https://github.com/xiaotonng/pikiloom). **Not** "an IM bridge for coding agents" — IM is one of several pluggable terminals.

Named for Urðr, first of the Norse Norns, who sits at the world tree and works out what
becomes of things. Nothing in the code carries the old loom/pikiloom vocabulary.

**Four layers (top → bottom):**

1. **Terminal** — IM channels (Telegram, Feishu) and the Web Dashboard are equal, pluggable entry points.
2. **Agent** — Wraps Claude Code and Codex through a driver registry; `claude-tui` is a PTY-passthrough backend of the claude driver, not a separately registered one.
3. **Model** — Routes across frontier models (Claude, GPT/Codex), domestic Chinese series (DeepSeek, 豆包, MiMo, MiniMax), OpenRouter, and any OpenAI-compatible proxy. Providers + Profiles vault injects credentials per agent at spawn time.
4. **Tool** — Skills, MCP servers, CLI tools, merged across global / workspace scopes.

The orchestrator is the product. Lead with the layered framing.

## Fork notes

Removed relative to upstream: the weixin / wecom / slack / discord / dingtalk channels, the
`gemini` and `hermes` drivers (in **both** `src/agent/drivers` and `packages/kernel/src/drivers`,
so kernel is no longer a drop-in match for the published `@pikiloom/kernel`), the local-model
catalog pages, and the marketing site. Merging from `upstream` will conflict in those areas.

State dir is `~/.urdr`; `~/.loomlet`, `~/.pikiloom` and `~/.pikiclaw` are migrated on first launch by
`migrateLegacyStateDir()`. The env prefix stays `PIKILOOM_*` because dozens of reads spell the
variable names out as literals — `LOOMLET_*` is accepted as an alias and hydrated at startup.

## Layered Dependencies

Imports flow strictly downward — no layer imports from a layer above it:

```
cli/  →  dashboard/  →  channels/*  →  bot/  →  agent/  →  catalog/, core/
```

## Key Concepts

- `bot/bot.ts` owns shared runtime state and `runStream()`
- `agent/stream.ts` is the CLI spawn framework; `agent/driver.ts` keeps agents pluggable
- `agent/mcp/bridge.ts` injects session-scoped MCP tools per stream; `agent/mcp/extensions.ts` merges global + workspace MCP config and resolves OAuth bearers
- `bot/human-loop.ts` is the single state machine for both Codex user-input and the `im_ask_user` MCP tool
- `browser-supervisor.ts` is the process-level singleton for the managed Chrome — streams call `ensure()`, never relaunch directly
- Each channel in `channels/*/` is physically isolated — touching Telegram never requires touching Feishu code

## Quick Reference

| Task | Files to read |
|------|---------------|

| Providers / Profiles / BYOK | `model/store.ts`, `model/injector.ts` |
| Add a recommended MCP / CLI / skill | `catalog/{mcp-servers,cli-tools,skill-repos}.ts` |
| Session management | `agent/session.ts`, `agent/types.ts` |
| Streaming behavior | `agent/stream.ts`, `bot/bot.ts` (`runStream`) |
| Add a Telegram command | `channels/telegram/bot.ts`, `bot/commands.ts` |
| Feishu rendering | `channels/feishu/render.ts`, `bot/render-shared.ts` |
| Dashboard API route | `dashboard/routes/*.ts`, `dashboard/runtime.ts` |
| MCP tool behavior | `agent/mcp/tools/*.ts`, `agent/mcp/bridge.ts` |
| MCP extension CRUD / OAuth | `agent/mcp/extensions.ts`, `agent/mcp/oauth.ts` |
| External CLI detection / auth | `agent/cli/detector.ts`, `agent/cli/auth.ts` |
| User config schema | `core/config/user-config.ts` |
| Cross-platform OS behavior | `core/platform.ts` |
| Managed browser lifecycle | `browser-supervisor.ts`, `browser-profile.ts` |

## Test Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run verify:toolchain               # also checks TS 7.0.2 + Node 22 types + Docker defaults
npm run dev                            # local dev (--no-daemon, logs to ~/.urdr/dev/dev.log)
npm test                               # Vitest unit suite (src + packages/kernel)
npx vitest run test/<file>.unit.test.ts
npx tsc --noEmit                                    # server
npx tsc -p dashboard/tsconfig.json --noEmit         # SPA
npx tsc -p packages/kernel/tsconfig.json --noEmit   # kernel
npm run build                           # clean + SPA + server + kernel; the real gate
```

`devEngines.runtime` accepts `22.23.1 || ^24 || ^25.2.0` (upstream allowed only 22/25). npm must
be exactly 11.6.2 — that one is still a hard gate, and `--engine-strict=false` does not bypass
`devEngines`.

**Windows baseline:** ~15 test files fail on Windows in a clean upstream checkout too (fake-CLI
shebangs, `encodeClaudeProjectDir` drive letters). Before claiming a regression, diff against a
baseline worktree rather than reading the raw failure count:

```bash
git worktree add /tmp/base main && cd /tmp/base && ln -s <repo>/node_modules node_modules
node <repo>/node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run    # npx re-triggers the devEngines gate here
```

## Notes

- Persistent config is `~/.urdr/setting.json`
- The Dashboard is part of the normal runtime, not just a setup helper
- This machine still runs the upstream pikiloom via `npx pikiloom@latest` (its own `~/.pikiloom` state); do not kill, replace, or "clean up" that process when the task only concerns urdr dev mode
- `npm run dev` rewrites `~/.urdr/dev/dev.log` on each launch. When invoked without a TTY (any tool-call / piped invocation) it auto-detaches into the background — no need for `run_in_background:true`. Force foreground with `PIKILOOM_DEV_FOREGROUND=1`, background with `PIKILOOM_DEV_BACKGROUND=1`. Stop it with `bash scripts/dev.sh --stop`.
- Dev mode isolates config: `PIKILOOM_CONFIG` points at `~/.urdr/dev/setting.json`, so the main `~/.urdr/setting.json` channels are NOT loaded. An empty `launching channels:` line in the dev log is expected unless that dev file has credentials of its own.
- `npm run dev` counts three `node.exe` processes on Windows for one runtime (`npx-cli.js` → `tsx/cli.mjs` → the worker). Only the innermost one binds the port; check `netstat -ano | grep :3940` rather than counting processes.
- For full architecture / extension / testing guides, see `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `INTEGRATION.md`, `TESTING.md`.
